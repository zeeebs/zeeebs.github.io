This repository is for my final (but not really as I am constantly updating it) version of my portfolio website.

<li><a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/zeeebs.github.io"_blank">Portfolio Website</a></li>
    <p>This is a portfolio website that introduces me and showcases my experience and knowledge. It was created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a menu bar, internal and external links, and a contact form. You can see the live site <a href="https://zeeebs.github.io/"_blank">here</a>.

  </ul>
