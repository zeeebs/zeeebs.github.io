# zeeebs.github.io

This repository is for the "final" version of my portfolio website. It will never truly be the final version, however, as it will continue to be updated as needed.

<p><a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/zeeebs.github.io"_blank">Portfolio Website</a></li>
    <p>This is a portfolio website that introduces me and showcases my experience and knowledge. It was created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a menu bar, internal and external links, and a contact form. You can see the live site <a href="https://zeeebs.github.io/"_blank">here</a>.

My resume is also added in this repository.
